# TODO

- Dishes:
  `In HTML, <dialog> cannot be a child of <tbody>. This will cause a hydration error.`
- Login page/modal for when you try to do something that needs auth.
- There is a problem with the date or timezone when creating party - default
  values doesn't show the right date.
- Should probably have a Date library
- Fix Logout
- Add user table (if necessary) - UUID instead of email.

- ~~Host should be able to edit party~~
