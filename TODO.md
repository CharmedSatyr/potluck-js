# TODO

- Login page/modal for when you try to do something that needs auth.

- Dishes:
  `In HTML, <dialog> cannot be a child of <tbody>. This will cause a hydration error.`
- Should probably have a Date library
- Fix Logout - auth state gets stale
- Add user table (if necessary) - UUID instead of email.
- Move auth into middleware.
- Don't send too much data to the client
- Loading indicators

- ~~Host should be able to edit party~~
