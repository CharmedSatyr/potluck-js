# TODO

## This Ticket

- Delete food plan row during creation

## High Priority

- View food plan
- Modify food plan
- Move auth into middleware.
- Don't send too much data to the client
- Loading indicators
- Fix Logout - auth state gets stale

## Other Priority

- Login page/modal for when you try to do something that needs auth.
- Dishes:
  `In HTML, <dialog> cannot be a child of <tbody>. This will cause a hydration error.`
- Should probably have a Date library
- Add user table (if necessary) - UUID instead of email.
